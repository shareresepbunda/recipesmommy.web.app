This healthy smoothie recipe has all the flavor of a pumpkin spice latte without all the sugar. For this smoothie you can use frozen or fresh bananas. Frozen bananas will create a more frothy texture, which I prefer. You definitely need to be sure to add ice if you are using fresh bananas because both the pumpkin and the bananas are at room temperature and no one likes a warm smoothie!
