This recipe is slightly sweet with mild heat that can be adjusted to your preference! I slightly prefered the fire roasted tomato version, but they were really very similar, not a big deal. I like chunkier onions in my salsa so next time I will probably throw them in chopped after processing other stuff, although this. Super Spicy Salsa, &#34;This is my kind of salsa!&#34; Just a few drops of it was enough to spice up your meat, tacos, and whatever else you were eating.
