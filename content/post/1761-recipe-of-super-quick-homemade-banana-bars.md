recipeingredient:
- " for the ice cream"
- "2 bananas cut and frozen"
- "2 Tbsp. almond butter plus more for swirling and drizzling"
- " for the chocolate coating"
- "2 Tbsp. coconut oil melted"
- "1/4 cup cocoa powder"
- "1 Tbsp. pure maple syrup"
- " chopped nuts optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the ice cream: Add bananas and almond butter to a food processor, and blend until creamy, scraping down the sides as necessary."
- "Once blended, swirl in an extra 1-2 tsp. almond butter with a spoon or knife. Don’t mix all the way – you want those nice nut buttery swirls in the final banana bars."
- "Divide the banana “ice cream” into two and pile them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Form into a square with a spatula. If it’s too melty, just pop it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes, then shape them into a square. Freeze until solid, about 3 hours."
- "Make the chocolate coating*: When your ice cream is frozen, make the chocolate coating. Place melted coconut oil, cocoa powder, and maple syrup in a shallow, wide-mouthed bowl. Stir until smooth. If it’s too thick (aka. glopy), add another tsp. melted coconut oil and stir. Keep in mind that you do want it on the thicker side, but not too thick that it can’t be poured."
- "Assemble your banana bars: Remove ice cream squares from the freezer. Dunk the tops and sides of the banana bars in the chocolate mixture, slightly heating and stirring the chocolate mixture between dunks. Sprinkle with nuts if desired."
- "Place back on the parchment-lined baking sheet, and freeze until set, about 30 minutes. Drizzle with almond butter mixed with a bit of coconut oil if desired."
- "NOTES  *I only coated the tops/sides of my banana bars with chocolate. If you want the entire thing covered with chocolate like the original, double the chocolate recipe."
