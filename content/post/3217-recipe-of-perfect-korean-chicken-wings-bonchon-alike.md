I happened to eat the famous Korean chicken wings at &#34;Bonchon&#34; restaurant in NYC last weekend. Koreans do know how to make their wings finger licking good. Bonchon&#39;s fried chicken was like candy: The skin&#39;s crisp was immaculate, the sauce was well-rounded and flavorful, and the meat slid right off the bone. I&#39;ve eaten more fried chicken in the last week than I&#39;ve eaten in the last year.
