recipeingredient:
- "1 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature"
- "2 cups confectioners sugar divided"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "2 1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon divided"
recipeinstructions:
- "In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or using a hand mixer, beat the butter on med-high speed until it is creamy, about 1 minute. Then beat in 3/4 cup of the confectioners sugar. Stop to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add in the vanilla extract."
- "On low speed, add in the sugar 1/4 cup at a time until it&#39;s all added in. Once it&#39;s all combined, add in the salt and 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon. Beat on high speed just until the dough comes together."
- "Cover the dough tightly and chill it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or up to 4 days). If you chill it for more than 3 hours, then let it sit out for 30 minutes or so before rolling, to make it easier to work with. In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/4 cup confectioners sugar with the remaining 1 tsp of cinnamon. Set that aside."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a few baking trays with either parchment paper or silicone baking mats."
- "Roll the dough to balls, about a tbsp of dough per ball. Place them about 1&#34; apart on the trays."
- "Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until lightly browned on the bottom. Once they&#39;re done, let them cool on the tray for 5 minutes."
- "After the initial 5 minutes, gently roll each ball around in the confectioners sugar, then place them on a wire rack to cool completely."
- "Once they&#39;re all completely cooled off, roll them again in the confectioners sugar (this time is when the sugar will really coat it well)."
- "Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days."
