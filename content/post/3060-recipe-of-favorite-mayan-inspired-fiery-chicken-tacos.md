recipeinstructions:
- "First: Prepare spices for dry rub in small mixing bowl and preheat grill to 350°-400°. If needed thaw chicken breasts, then spread dry rub evenly on both sides of breasts. Grill chicken until center reaches 165° and outside is slightly blackened. (About 15-20mins)"

- "For guacamole: Cut open and discard pit of avocado. Spoon out interior and mash with fork till mostly smooth. (I prefer a few chunks of avocado.) Then mix in cilantro, onion, garlic, tomato, and pepper together in bowl. Add salt, lime juice and black pepper and mix. Put a lid or cellophane on top of bowl and then refrigerate until ready to serve."
- "Once chicken is complete, remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes, then slice into strips."
- "Serve together or separately with chips! I like serving then as tacos with a little cheese and sour cream, but that is entirely up to you. Enjoy!"
- "P.S. for a little kick add some habanero pepper sauce! Remember a little habanero goes a long way!"
