When I was younger I did not care for mangoes but I recently discovered that I like I figured that the sweet mangoes would go well with the tart rhubarb. I went with a pretty basic recipe and added some grated ginger and coconut to. Here&#39;s a tropical spin on a traditional fruit crumble, with pineapple and mango as the base and shaved coconut sprinkled over the standard buttery topping.
