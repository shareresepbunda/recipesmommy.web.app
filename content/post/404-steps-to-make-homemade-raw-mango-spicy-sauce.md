I love the mango chutney they serve with papad in some north Indian restaurants, though I have not tasted many, just few times. Diced mango is combined with spicy habanero peppers and ginger for a perky sauce. Mango-wise, Champagne/Ataulfo mangoes seem to work best. These bright yellow, smaller mangoes were given the name Champagne mangoes partially for marketing purposes, and also for their perky flavor.
