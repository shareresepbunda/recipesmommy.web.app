Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, tilapia with mango salsa. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

The salsa can be made the day ahead to save time. Strawberries can be substituted for the mango if you prefer--both are excellent! Combine leftover salsa with some drained black beans the next day for lunch.
