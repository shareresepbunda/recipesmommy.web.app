We prefer this without the cheese. This simple salmon soup is made with canned salmon and a little onion, giving you a lot of flavor for very little work. It&#39;s warming and comforting without being overly heavy, which I like. And what&#39;s more, it can be made quite well with the meat left on the racks of salmon or trout, so you waste less.

The flavor of this salmon chowder is greatly enhanced by adding either fresh dill or dried tarragon: each herb lends its own distinctively different and appealing character to the soup.
