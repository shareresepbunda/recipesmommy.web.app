- "CANTALOUPES                                  Vitamin C in cantaloupes is effective in regulating menstrual flow and relieving menstrual cramps in women. Regular consumption of cantaloupe during menstruation can reduce the flow and clotting considerably; and get rid of other menstrual problems. Cantaloupe is also sometimes used to induce menstruation."
- "BANANAS                                                                                  Evidence suggests that bananas may help reduce cramps associated with menstruation. In addition to being a rich food source of anti-cramping nutrients such as vitamin B6, bananas are loaded with potassium which helps reduce water retention.

It is loaded with important nutrients, and it can be used to treat various health problems, including menstrual cramps. It contains apiol, a compound that has been shown to be highly effective at stimulating the menstrual process and relieving menstrual cramps."
- "WHEAT GERM                                                                                 Wheat germ may be one of the best foods you can include in your diet if you suffer from menstrual cramps. It provides a concentrated source of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), with a mere cup of crude wheat germ providing a whopping 75% of the recommended daily intake for this important vitamin! Wheat germ is also an excellent source of other B vitamins as well as zinc. What&#39;s more, it contains very high amounts of vitamin E and magnesium."
