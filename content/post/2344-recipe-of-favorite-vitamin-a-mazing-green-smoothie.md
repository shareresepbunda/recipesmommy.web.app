We love adding raw maca powder to green smoothies! Not only will it add a slighty, sweet, malted flavor to your smoothie, but it also works as a natural pain reliever and mood and energy booster! Try adding some raw mighty maca powder along with creamy ingredients like bananas and avocado to your next green smoothie. Kale: rich in beta-carotene, vitamin K, calcium and fiber, this dark, leafy green delivers a big nutritional punch. With some blenders, its fibrous leaves can result in a chunky texture, but a Vitamix blender incorporates it seamlessly.
