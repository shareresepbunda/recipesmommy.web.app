recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400°F or 375°F for dark or nonstick pans."
- "Completely cook bacon (I like to cook mine stove top), but DO NOT cook too crispy. Bacon has to be flexible so it will not break apart in buns. As pieces of bacon are done, drain grease off onto paper towel."
- "Take the end of a cinnamon bun and unravel it so it makes a straight line of doe. Take 1 strip of the cooked bacon and lay it in the middle of the doe. Take end of dough and roll back up into a bun. If the bacon was flexible then there should be no problem with any bacon breakage."
- "Bake cinnamon buns according to cook time on your can or until a nice golden brown color. Once you let them cool for about 10-12 minutes, then ice them. It will be a mouth watering surprise!"

The bacon was the perfectly subtle touch to kick the oooey-gooey, sweet, icing-y cinnamon rolls up a notch. The recipe was excellent but a bit time intensive with the dough having to rise TWICE. Use Oscar Meyer Fully cooked bacon instead of fresh bacon that you pre-fry a bit and the bacon comes out PERFECT in these cinnamon rolls!
