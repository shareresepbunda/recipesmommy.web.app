recipeingredient:
- " Salsa"
- "3 tbsp Olive oil"
- "2 Dried chiles de arbol"
- "8 large Tomatillos husked and rinsed"
- "3 medium Heirloom tomatoes"
- "2 Red jalapeo peppers"
- "1 Green jalapeo pepper"
- "1 bunch Scallions trimmed"
- " Kosher salt"
- " Vegetable oil for the grill"
- "2 clove Garlic"
- "1 cup Coarsely chopped fresh cilantro"
- "1 Juice of lemon"
- " Steaks"
- "4 Boneless ribeye steaks 12 oz each"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
- " Kosher salt and black pepper"
- " Special Equipment"
- "3 cup Hickory wood chips soaked in cold water for 1 hour"
- "1 Smoker wood chip box or 913 inch aluminumfoil pan for gas"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the salsa: prepare a grill for high heat. In a small heavy skillet, combine the olive oil and chilies De Arbole and cook over medium heat, about four minutes, or until the chiles are toasted and beginning to blacken. Remove the chiles and set aside. Allow the chile oil to cool slightly."
- "On a large baking sheet, toss the tomatillos, tomatoes, jalapeños and scallions with the chile oil and season with salt. Lightly oil the grill grates with vegetable oil, place the vegetables on the grill and close the lid. Cook the vegetables, turning only once, until they are blackened as much as possible; don&#39;t stress out if the tomatoes and Tomatillos break open and begin to fall apart - it&#39;s a sign that they&#39;re cooked through. Aim for these cooking times: eight minutes per side for the tomatoes and tomatillos, about six minutes per side for the jalapeños and about three minutes per side for the scallions. Using tongues, transfer the vegetables to the baking sheet and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, let the steaks stand at room temperature, 30 minutes."
- "Trim the stems from the jalapeños and remove the seeds, if desired. Do not remove the charred skins. In a blender, combine the blackened vegetables, The garlic, cilantro, lemon juice and the toasted chiles de arbol and blend until smooth. Season the salsa to taste with salt. (you will have about 5 cups salsa; it will keep for up to five days, stored airtight in the refrigerator.)"
- "Make the steaks: reduce the grill heat to medium high. For a gas grill, spread the drained Woodchips in the smoker box and close it; alternatively, spread the woodchips in the foil pan. Place the Smokebox or foil pan on a lit burner. For a charcoal grill, sprinkle the drained wood chips over the hot coals."
- "Coat the steaks with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. When you see the woodchips beginning to smoke, set the steaks on the grill grate and grill them 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until the meat feels only slightly resilient when pressed with a fingertip, for medium rare. Transfer the steaks to a carving board and let rest, uncovered, about five minutes. Serve the steaks with the salsa."
