- "° Blend until desired consistency.                                                           ° If opting for a creamy avacado salsa - blend or smash avacado separately and mix it in your salsa once salsa has cooled."

- "° If you feel your salsa is too acidic due to the tomatillos, jalapeños and chiles, while salsa is at a high simmer - add 1/4 tsp Baking Soda. Mix well. Your salsa will foam up but she&#39;ll settle right down. Add another 1/4 tsp at a time until you&#39;re satisfied with the acidity.                                                                                                                                                       ° Definitely add 1/3 cup of your favorite green purchased salsa! And, it&#39;s not cheating! It has preservatives that will tame the acid considerably. Add it last as your salsa cools down. Pedros is a great brand! Spicy but delicious!"
- "Serve hot or chilled with guacamole and sour cream to tame the heat. Also, with tortilla chips, tacos or burritos. Enjoy!"
