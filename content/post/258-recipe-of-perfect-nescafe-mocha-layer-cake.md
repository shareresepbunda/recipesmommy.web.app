recipeinstructions:
- "Line and grease an 8” x 8” cake pan."
- "Using an electric hand mixer, beat A (butter, sugar and Ovalette) until pale and creamy."
- "Add in B and beat until well combined."
- "Add C (eggs) one by one, mixing well after each addition."
- "Next, add in D (sifted ingredients) in two additions. Mix well after each addition using the lowest speed of your mixer. Stop once batter is looking smooth. Divide batter equally into three separate bowls (Bowl - A, B and C) and add the flavours."
- "Bowl A - plain batter. Bowl B - coffee essence and milo (mix well). Bowl C - browning sugar and mocha paste (mix well)."
- "Baking and Layering- preheat oven to 150°C (depending on the oven). Start with Bowl C. Divide batter in Bowl C into three portions. Put the first portion into the baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake this first layer for 10-13 minutes using ‘bake’ function."
- "Remove from the oven and put the second portion of the batter (of the same colour) on top of the cooked layer. Bake again for 10-13 minutes but this time using the grill function (top heat). Repeat the same process with the last portion (of bowl C)."
- "Repeat the same process with bowl B and bowl A. As for the very last layer (last portion from Bowl A), turn the oven back into ‘bake’ function. Cover the cake with aluminum foil (optional-only if the top last layer browning too fast) and bake for 15 minutes. Remove and leave to cool before serving."
- "Note: Thinner layer needs shorter time to bake (5-7mins). As for this one, the layer is slightly thicker, hence the 10-13mins. Lightly press each (cooked) layer with something flat to remove any excess air before putting the next one. This is still optional. Some would brush a very thin layer of jam (of any kind) or condensed milk on top of the cooked layer. Jam or condensed milk is used to glue/bind the layers together."
