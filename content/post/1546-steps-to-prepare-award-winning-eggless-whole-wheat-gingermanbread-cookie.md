recipeingredient:
- "2 cups whole wheat flour"
- "1/2 cup all purpose flour maida"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "125 grams butter softened"
- "1/2 cup molasses or replace it with honey golden syrup or maple syrup"

- "1 cup icing sugar"
- "1.5 tbsp milk"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "as required extra flour for dusting while rollig cookies"
- "4 tbsp extra milk if required if the dough gets dry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dry ingredients Mix: In a bowl sift whole wheat flour, maida, ginger powder, cinnamon powder, nutmeg powder, black pepper powder."
- "Wet Ingredients Mix: In another bowl take soften butter, brown sugar, and flax seed powder. Beat them well with the electric beater for 3-4 minutes until light and fluffy. Add the molasses and beat it again on high speed for 3-4 minutes. It should be light and fluffy."
- "Now fold in gently the dry ingredients in two batches. Mix them with a spatula. Now mix them with your fingers and knead to make a soft dough."
- "Shape it in a disc and clingwrap it. Fridge it for 30 minutes. If possible you can cool it more."
- "Remove from the fridge and divide into four parts and shape it into a ball. Dust it with flour and roll it to 4mm thickness. (Since whole wheat flour is used, the dough can become dry while rolling. Just put some milk and smoothen it and then dust it with flour and roll). It&#39;s time for asking your kids help now.

- "Line a baking tray with butter paper and place the cookies on it. Sprinkle some regular sugar over it. Bake it in a preheated oven @ 170 C for 10 minutes or just golden. Do not bake more. The cookies will become hard. They will be soft when removed from oven. Place them to cool."
- "In the meantime prepare icing. Take icing sugar in a bowl. Add milk and vanilla essence to it. Mix them well. Put them in a piping bag or a simple cone make from plastic sheet or butter paper."
- "Decorate the cooled cookies as per your choice."
- "They are ready to serve, store and wrap. Just gift and eat them. Enjoy with a hot cup of milk or tea."
