Just remember: When you blend the watermelon, you&#39;ll end up with about half the amount of juice (eight cups of watermelon in the Watermelon Margarita Mocktails will blend down to about four cups of juice.) Most of these cocktail recipes are simple and require just one or two steps after you&#39;ve blended the juice. Fresh watermelon calls for a super fresh cocktail and it doesn&#39;t get much fresher than the mojito. It&#39;s one of the best drinks of summer and it&#39;s just a little better with some juicy melon. The Independence Day mojito is very simple.
