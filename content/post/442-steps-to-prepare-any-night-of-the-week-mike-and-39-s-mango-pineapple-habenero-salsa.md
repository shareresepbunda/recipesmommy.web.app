recipeinstructions:
- "Be very careful when peeling mangos. They are an extremely slippery fruit and a very sharp knife is required to work with them. Just slice all 4 sides [or cheeks as they&#39;re known] away from the hard seed core. If the mangos are ripe enough, you can simply spoon the meat out of skins. If they&#39;re firm, carefully slice the meat from the skin with your sharp knife. Reserve 1 mango for your salsa finish."
- "Place vegetables and fruits on your 500° greased grill. Watch them closely. You&#39;re just wanting a char."
- "Pull veggies off heat when you start to see blistering or charring. Be careful not to seriously burn anything."
- "Wear gloves and chop stems from peppers. Remove seeds and membranes if you want to ease the heat a bit. Add all ingredients except for your reserved mango and pulse in blender until blended with some chunks. Add pineapple juice as well."
- "Another option to add. Just be careful not to add too much fluid. Peaches are great as well!"
- "Jarred Peaches"
- "Blended salsa pictured."
- "Lastly, add your remaining mango and rough chop it in your blender on your pulse option. Your guests should be able to see that it&#39;s mango. ☺ Refrigerate for at least 2 hours."
- "This recipe could easily make eight 8 oz jars of salsa. They also make for great gifts! Garnish jars with thin Habenero slices, fresh Cilantro leaves and lime wedges."
- "Enjoy with extra salty, seasoned homemade tortilla chips!"
