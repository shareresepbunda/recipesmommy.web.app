recipeinstructions:
- "To make the crust: Stir in the flour and sugar together in a large bowl, then add the butter and rub in your fingertips until the mixture looks like crumbs."
- "Break in the egg and work into the mixture with your fingers, breaking it together to form a soft dough."
- "Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a ball. Flatten with your fingers to a disc and wrap in cling film. Chill for at least 1 hour before using."
- "After 1 hour, remove the dough from fridge. Dust your work surface (and rolling pin) with flour, roll the dough thinly, about 3-4 mm thickness. Use a 7 cm cutter to stamp the dough."
- "Place the cut dough over a tart tin (mine is 5.5cm top/3cm base) and gently press it downwards. Using finger tips, gently press and mold the dough into the tart tin."
- "Use a fork to poke holes at the base of the tart cases. Bake the tarts at 180C for 10 mins."
- "The tarts will be slightly browned. Let them cool completely before use."
- "To make the fillings: Add cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh milk and salted butter into a thick-based pot. Keep whisking the mixture till everything is melted."
- "Once the mixture has melted, add corn starch and icing sugar. Mix till well-blended, the mixture will thicken slowly."
- "Add the eggs, vanilla extract and lemon juice. Mix till well-blended, the mixture will further thicken into custard. Taste the custard and if desired, add some sea salt to increase intensity of cheese taste."
- "There may be still some fine lumps and grainy bits in the custard, sifting will yield a more velvety smooth custard. This is optional."
- "Pipe the filling into the tart crust. Brush the top of the cheese tart with egg yolk."
- "Bake the tart at 230 C for 6-7 mins until it&#39;s browned on top."
- "Serve them hot from the oven, they taste better when hot/warm!"
