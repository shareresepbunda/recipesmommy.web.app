recipeingredient:
- " Pork Chops"
- "4 Pork Chops Bonein or Boneless"
- " Salt"
- " pepper"
- " Paprika"
- "4 tbsp Flour"
- "2 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil"
- " Stroganoff Sauce"
- "33/100 cup Bourbon"
- "3/4 cup Sliced Mushrooms"
- "3/4 cup Chopped Onion"
- "3/4 cup Chopped Bell Pepper any colors"
- "1 1/2 cup Pork Stock"
- "1 can Cream of Mushroom Soup"
- "3/4 cup Sour Cream"
- " Server Over Choice Of"
- "1 Prepared Egg Noodles"
- "1 Prepared Rice White or Brown"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the Extra Virgin Olive Oil in a frying pan over medium / medium high heat.  Salt, Pepper and Paprika both sides of the Pork Chops to taste.  Dust both sides of the seasoned Pork Chops with Flour, knock off any excess.  Put the Pork Chops in the frying pan and cook about 4 minutes on each side to create a nice sear.  Remove the chops from the frying pan, set to the side."
- "(Note: I don&#39;t always have Pork Stock on hand, but usually have both Beef and Chicken Stock.  In such cases I have mixed 3/4 cup of both together and this still comes out great.)"
- "Turn the heat down to medium.  Add the Bourbon to deglaze the pan.  Add in the Mushrooms, Onions and Bell Peppers.  Saute until the veggies are almost tender, about 6 minutes.  Then add 1/2 cup of the Pork Stock and let it cook and reduce down for a few minutes."
- "(Note: From here, the rest can be done 2 ways.  If you&#39;d like, and your frying pan is large enough, you can do everything in the frying pan.  I prefer to switch to a dutch oven.)"
- "Pour the rest of the Pork Stock into the dutch oven and about half of the cooked veggies.  Place the Pork Chops on top.  Add the rest of the veggies on top.  Bring the Pork Stock to a boil, turn the heat to low, then cover and simmer.  The longer you let this go the more &#34;fall-off-the-bone&#34; the Pork chops will be.  I go about 40 minutes."
- "When the Pork Chops are cooked to your liking, remove them from the dutch oven.  Add in the can of Cream of Mushroom soup and mix until it&#39;s smooth.  Then stir in the Sour Cream.  Return the Pork Chops into the Sauce/Gravy, spoon some on top of the Pork Chops.  Put the cover back on and bring the sauce to a low boil.  Let it simmer 5 minutes."
- "Serve the Pork Chops and Sauce/Grave over your choice of Egg Noodles or Rice."
