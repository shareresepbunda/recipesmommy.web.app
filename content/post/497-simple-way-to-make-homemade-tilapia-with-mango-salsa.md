Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, tilapia with mango salsa. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

The salsa can be made the day ahead to save time. Strawberries can be substituted for the mango if you prefer--both are excellent! Combine leftover salsa with some drained black beans the next day for lunch.
