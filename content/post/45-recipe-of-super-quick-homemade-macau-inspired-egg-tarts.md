recipeingredient:
- "1 sheet Frozen puff pastry"
- "250 ml Milk"
- "3 tbsp Granulated sugar"
- "2 Egg yolk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Roll the puff pastry sheet out as thinly as you can and fit it into the muffin tray mould (it&#39;ll be easier if you cut the pastry with a 10 cm cookie cutter, then fit it into the mould). You don&#39;t have to stretch the pastry so it peeps out of the mould."
- "Cover the pastry in parchment paper and pie weights and bake on the top shelf of your oven for 15 minutes at 200℃."
- "Add the milk and sugar to a saucepan and heat. When the mixture starts to bubble, continue to stir it for about 15 minutes or until the mixture has reduced to half its original size."
- "When the mixture has cooled, add in the egg yolks and vanilla essence and mix. Then strain the mixture."
- "Pour an even portion of the egg mixture into each of the tart crusts from Step 2. The mixture may seem to be a bit hard, but don&#39;t worry. Bake on the top shelf of the oven at 230℃ for 12-13 minutes until golden brown."
- "The egg tarts that I ate in Macau had a nice crispy pastry but tasted of cheap oil, which was a shame!"
