That said, not all salmon fillets come with the belly and are much more uniform in thickness overall."
- "Spread fillet with Ranch dressing. (For 1.5 pounds, I used about 3 Tablespoons.)"
- "Then spread fillet with BBQ sauce in the same quantity as Ranch dressing."
- "Squeeze the juice of half a lime over the entire fillet and sprinkle with green onions."
