- "4 Cups Steamed Rice"
- "4 Pork Chops"
- "to taste Salt Pepper and Sage"
- "1/4 Cup butter"
- "2-10 oz. cans Mushroom Soup"
- "1 can (10 oz.) water"
- "4 oz. fresh sliced Mushrooms optional"
- "4 Cups steamed Broccolli Crowns"
recipeinstructions:
- "Steam the rice first and keep warm til serving. Prepare according to your rice cooker instructions or use minute rice and steam on top of stove. When using minute rice, use equal amounts of water and rice. Boil water first. Then place rice in pan of water, remove from heat, cover with lid, and let set for 10 minutes before it is ready to serve. Stir rice before serving. I prefer regular rice (Jasmine is my favorite) done in the rice cooker."

- "While Pork Chops are cooking use whip to blend Mushroom Soup with the can of water until it takes on a gray consistency."
- "When Pork Chops are done, pull them from skillet and plate them."
- "Pour Mushroom Gravy into skillet and stir. Add about a tablespoon of worcestershire to the gravy and stir again. This adds color appeal and enhances the flavor of the gravy. If you opted to add fresh sliced mushrooms, add them now."
- "At this point, place Pork Chops back in the gravy, cover with a lid, and &#34;simmer&#34; on low. Do not allow gravy to boil. Boiling will make the chops tough."
- "While Pork Chops simmer, steam broccolli in a steaming basket in a covered pot of boiling water. Steam until broccolli is tender. (approximately 15 minutes after water comes to a boil) Be careful to not over cook."
- "When Pork Chops and Gravy, Rice, and Broccolli are done, serve while warm. Spoon gravy over rice. I love to serve applesauce with this meal. No dessert needed!"
