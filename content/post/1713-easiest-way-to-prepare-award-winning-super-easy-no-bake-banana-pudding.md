recipeingredient:
- "1 (5 ounce) Package Instant Vanilla Pudding"
- "2 3/4 Cups Cold Milk"
- "1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract"
- "14 Ounce Can Sweetened Condensed Milk"
- "8 Ounce Package Whipped Topping"
- "1 Box Nilla Style Wafers"
- "4 MediumSized Ripe Bananas"
- "Splash Lemon Juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Whisk together pudding mix, milk, a vanilla extract until well combined. 2-3 minutes. Put in refrigerator to keep cold and set up some. Note: (I use a little less milk than called for on the package) Helps ensure that everything sets up well."
- "When pudding starts to soft set, fold in sweetened condensed Milk and the whipped topping. Note: (I only add about 3/4 each of these two ingredients) Cuts down on the sweetness level and the dish as a whole sets up better. Place back in the refrigerator to keep cool."
- "Slice up bananas in a bowl. Splash bananas with a little lemon juice, and toss to coat. This helps prevent the bananas from darkening."
- "Layer pudding mix, bananas, and vanilla wafers in serving bowl of your choice. Keep repeating until you have no more room left. Serve well chilled."
