recipeingredient:
- "as needed spray sunflower oil"
- "470 ml can of full fat coconut milk"
- "180 ml light corn syrup  golden syrup"
- "350 g granulated sugar"
- "180 ml water"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Line an 8&#34; square cake tin or glass dish with greaseproof / parchment paper. Spray the paper with oil and set aside"
- "Combine the coconut milk, vanilla and syrup in a large, deep pan over a medium heat, stirring until the mixture is warm and the syrup has just dissolved into the milk. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside"
- "Add the sugar and water to another pan and heat, without stirring, until the sugar has dissolved and turned a golden colour. It will take a little while, around 20 minutes maybe. A candy thermometer should read 154C / 310F"
- "Quickly pour the sugar into the coconut milk. It will spit so be careful! Put the coconut milk pan back on the stove on medium-low and keep stirring to dissolve the caramel sugar into the mixture"
- "Then turn the heat up to medium-high and cook, stirring continuously until the thermometer reads 115C / 240F or soft ball stage. It will bubble and rise furiously at the beginning but it will settle down a bit when the temp creeps up. Again this will take a wee while"
- "Pour quickly into the cake tin and let stand at room temperature for 24 hours until set"
- "Release from the tin and cut into 1&#34; cubes. It&#39;s easiest to cut if you wet your sharp knife in the spray oil between slices"
- "Wrap any extra caramels in parchment paper and store in an airtight container for up to a week"
