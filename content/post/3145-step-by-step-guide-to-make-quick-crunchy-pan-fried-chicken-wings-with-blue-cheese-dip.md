recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cups allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 cup cornstarch"
- "2 tbsp salt"
- "2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 large pack chicken wings and drumettes about 4 dozen pieces"
- "1/2 cup whipping cream"
- "100 g blue cheese"
- " Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 tbsp mayonnaise"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, and several grinds of black pepper."
- "Pat the wings dry and add them to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle in a couple of pinches of salt and toss. Use a ladle to scoop in some of the flour mixture, then toss the wings again. Keep going until you run out of flour mixture and all the wings are nicely coated."
- "Shake the excess flour off the wings. Lay them in a single layer on a parchment covered cookie sheet. Put the wings uncovered in the fridge for 30 minutes."
- "Put a large, wide-bottomed frying pan on medium heat and fill it about 3/4 inch with veg oil. If you have a frying thermometer, use it to measure when the oil reaches 350 F. If, like me, you don&#39;t have one, take your best guess as to when the oil&#39;s hot enough."
- "Cook the wings in the oil in batches of 10 to 12 at a time. Flip them after 6 minutes to fry the other side. After about another 6 minutes they should be done. You&#39;ll know they&#39;re cooked when the bubbling of the oil slows down. Lay the cooked wings out on a paper towel lined plate. In between batches of wings, make the blue cheese dip."
- "Add the whipping cream to a small pot on medium-low heat. Once the cream has warmed up, whisk the blue cheese in a small chunk at a time until melted and smooth. Whisk in 4 to 5 dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Take the pot off the heat to cool."
- "When you&#39;re ready to serve, add the mayonnaise to the cooled cheese cream. Add extra salt to taste and stir well to combine"
