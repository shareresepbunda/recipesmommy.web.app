Turn to high and add peas and barley for last hour. I usually use stew meat or round steaks for this recipe. Less expensive cuts of meat actually have more flavor than expensive cuts do and are great in soup. I recently made this soup on a rare cold and dreary day here in sunny Arizona. It was the perfect day for staying home and doing little things around the house while the pot simmered away on the stovetop.
