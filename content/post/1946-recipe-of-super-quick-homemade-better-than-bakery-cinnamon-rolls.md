- "2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "To scald milk, add to saucepan and heat until just boiling. Remove from the heat and pour into a large bowl with the softened butter. Stir until melted and add sugar. Test the temperature. It should be just above lukewarm (too hot will kill the yeast). If it is too warm, add 1/4 cup flour and test again."
- "Stir in yeast and let rise 10 minutes until foamy. Mix in eggs, salt, and flour up to 4 cups. Mix until dough pulls away from sides."
- "Knead dough 10 minutes, adding an additional 1/4 cup flour after first 3-4 minutes. Roll onto floured surface into a large 16 x 20 rectangle."
- "For the filling: Mix all ingredients until well combined. Set out until ready to use."
- "Spread filling onto dough, leaving a 1/2 inch bare on one long side. Roll tightly from the filled end to the bare end. Cut into 12 equal pieces and set in baking dish lined with parchment paper. Set out to rise at least 30 minutes while the oven preheats to 350 degrees."
- "Bake rolls 20-25 minutes until the edges are golden brown and centers are puffed up."
- "For the glaze: combine butter, cream cheese, and vanilla in a small saucepan and stir until smooth over low heat. Pour 3/4 glaze over rolls immediately. Let sit for 10 minutes and glaze again. Enjoy. 😍"
- "To make ahead of time, follow instructions through putting the rolls in the baking dish. Then cover with plastic and refrigerate until ready to use. (Don&#39;t forget to let it rise!)"
