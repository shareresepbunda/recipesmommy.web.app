Black Pepper Beef is one of my favorite recipes in the cookbook as I love the combination of bell pepper and black pepper in Chinese stir-fries. These two ingredients, coupled with the right cut of beefâ€”I like beef tenderloin, flank steak or flap meatâ€”will often guarantee a successful dish. Black pepper chicken is one of the meals on my dinner rotation menu. Not only because it&#39;s so delicious, but also because it is loaded with healthy lean protein and colorful veggies that makes it perfect as a one-pot meal.
