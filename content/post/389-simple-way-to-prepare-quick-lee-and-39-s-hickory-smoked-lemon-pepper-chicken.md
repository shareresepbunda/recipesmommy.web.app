recipeinstructions:
- "Remove backbone from chicken and flatten down. (Spatchcock) Generously season front and back side of chicken with Kosher Salt, and repeat with Lemon Pepper Seasoning. Place uncovered in refrigerator skin side up, for 24 hours. This is called dry brining. Note: &#34;Do not use regular iodized table salt!&#34;"
- "Next day take out the chicken and bring it up to room temperature. Do not re-season the chicken. Meanwhile prepare your smoker or grill for cooking. I shoot for a smoking temperature of 250 degrees or a little warmer, up to 300 degrees."
- "When ready place chicken skin side down and start cooking."
- "After about 1 hour flip chicken skin side up. Continue cooking until the breast meat is around 160 -165 degrees internal temperature. You really need a digital meat thermometer for this. A 5 lb hen generally takes me 1.5 hours give or take a few."
- "When finished remove and lest rest at least 30 minutes before carving. You and your family will very much enjoy. Message me with any questions. Note: The big advantage to spatchcocked chicken, is that there is more dark meat exposed to the heat. Therefore it cooks faster and the dark and white meat, are generally done at the same time."
