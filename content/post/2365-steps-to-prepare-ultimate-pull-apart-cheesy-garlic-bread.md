There are very few foods that have the comforting, almost sedative, effect of warm aromatic bread. Throughout the year, we try to keep carbs on the down-low, only. Pull apart garlic rolls make the best side to most dinners. I have friends who have never made homemade bread or rolls because the idea of working with yeast scares them to death!
