- "1 pound Shishito Peppers"
- "1 cup flour"
- "1/4 cup corn meal"
- "1/2 cup corn starch"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "3 tsp salt"
- "12 oz light beer"
- "1 quart sunflower oil or other cooking oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pour oil into a large rimmed cast iron pan and heat. I like sunflower ðŸŒ» oil because of itâ€™s high (450â€¢) smoking point and neutral flavor, but any oil will do. Just get it hot as possible without any popping or smoking."
- "Mix flour, corn meal, corn starch, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl, pour in beer and incorporate into a batter"
- "Dip peppers in batter and fry them in oil until golden brown. I did batches of 8 to keep them manageable. The peppers will float, so keep tings ready to flip them over and cook both sides"

- "WOW! You just made an elevated appetizer or crispy snack to share with your friends! They must love you! Consider serving with Sriracha to dip :)"
