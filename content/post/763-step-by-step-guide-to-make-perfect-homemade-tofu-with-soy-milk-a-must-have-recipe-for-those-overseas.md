recipeinstructions:
- "Buy soy milk with 7.2% protein content at the supermarket or health food store."
- "Dissolve the epsom salt in 100 to 150 ml of water."
- "Add the salt solution little by little to the soy milk in a bowl. Stir gently and let it stand for 1 minute. At this point, you can see the mixture starting to separate. Microwave at 500 W for 12 minutes. After heating, pour the softly-set tofu into a mould. Microwave for another 2 minutes."
- "I bought a wooden mold for making 2 blocks in Japan. If you use a 1 block mold, you need a 1 liter carton of soy milk. For a 2 block-mold, use two 1 liter cartons."

- "Fold the excess fabric over and put a weight on the tofu to press down."
- "After draining, place the tofu wrapped in a cloth into water in a bowl to remove the excess epsom salt. You can omit this process if you like because the amount nigari won&#39;t make the tofu bitter. It is done!"
- "Buy soy milk with 7.2% protein content."
