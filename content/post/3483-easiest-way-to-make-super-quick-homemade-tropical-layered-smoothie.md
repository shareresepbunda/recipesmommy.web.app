recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and cut the strawberries, mangoes, pineapple and bananas and spread on butter paper or parchment paper lined pan to freeze for about 15 to 30 minutes."
- "To make the bottom strawberry layer: Remove the frozen or chilled fruit slices from the freezer. Combine sliced strawberries, half a banana, coconut milk, lemon juice and some lemon zest in a blender. Blend to a smooth paste; you may have to do it in small bursts as the fruits are frozen."
- "Divide strawberry smoothie between 2 glasses; it is easier to spoon them to form perfect layers, smoothening the top as you go. Return the glass to the freezer to set the bottom strawberry layer, for about 30 minutes."
- "To make the middle mango layer: Combine mangoes, ½ a banana, coconut milk and saffron infused mixture and blend to a smooth puree. Layer this on top of the frozen strawberry layer, leveling the top. Freeze another 30 minutes."
- "To make the pineapple layer: Combine pineapple, banana, and coconut milk in a blender and make a smooth puree. Remove the frozen smoothie glass from the freezer and layer this mixture gently over the second mango layer and level again. The layering of the smoothie can be made easier if you spoon the mixture into the glass."
- "Serve immediately or chill for another 5 to 10 minutes and serve with a straw. Enjoy!"
- "Add some honey if the mangoes and pineapples are not too sweet. For a vegan option, use sugar or agave syrup to sweeten the smoothie.  Keep frozen fruits ready in the freezer and this smoothie can be ready in no time.  If you do not want to layer the smoothies, enjoy the fruit smoothies separately as strawberry smoothie, mango and pineapple smoothies! #satwik"
