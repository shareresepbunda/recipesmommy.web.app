##### The ingredients needed to make Refreshing After Dinner Smoothie:

1. Get 1 banana
1. Take 1 golden kiwi
1. Prepare  Around 6 strawberries
1. Prepare Handful ice
1. Prepare  Watermelon chunks
1. Make ready 1 Tbsp honey
1. Prepare  Around 2 cups orange juice
1. Get Handful spinach
1. Take 6 oz French vanilla yogurt
1. Prepare 3 cucumber slices


But perhaps the most appropriate drinks to mix up right after a big meal are those that settle your stomach and your mind. Smoothies for dinner might not be the norm, but there are plenty of reasons to sometimes swap out your usual chicken-and-veggies combo for a nutrient-dense drink. While beer and wine are perfectly respectable for relaxing after dinner or unwinding after, say, mowing the lawn, few things go better with a Saturday spent hanging by the backyard (inflatable) pool than a refreshing cocktail, or a batch of ice-cold summer drinks. Whether you&#39;re looking to make a quick mixed drink for you and a loved one or a big pitcher of sangria or round of frozen drinks to.

I&#39;ve been tasked to bring a nice, refreshing after dinner drink/digestive, for a dinner party I&#39;m attending tomorrow night. My first thought was to find some nice limoncella; I&#39;ve had it before and I think it&#39;s fairly easy to procure from any ABC store. I&#39;d rather bring something other; something not as common as that Italian fave.
