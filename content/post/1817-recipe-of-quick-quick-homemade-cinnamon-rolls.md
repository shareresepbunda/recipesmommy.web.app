Toss in the oven and bake as directed no need to proof them in the oven. Holds up to one month in freezer."
- "Filling options: you can use 1 tablespoon on cinnamon and 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice instead for a fall tasting roll, or spread really any fruit filling inside instead of the cinnamon sugar butter mixture."
