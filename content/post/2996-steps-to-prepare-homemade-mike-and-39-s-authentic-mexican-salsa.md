- "1 tsp Ground Cumin"
- "1/2 tsp Mexican Oregano"
- "1 tsp Each Garlic Powder  Onion Powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Throw everything in a blender and blend to the consistency of your preference. Know that there&#39;s not a lot of fluid in this specific Salsa recipe. Slowly add fluids like broth or water to your preference."
- "Refrigerate straight from the blender or, you can cook this salsa in a pot on the stove until boiling - then simmer for only a few minutes. Then refrigerate. It&#39;s better to boil it tho."
- "If you decide your salsa is a bit too acidic tasting [caused by tomatoes &amp; jalapeños] for your liking - add 1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda while your salsa is bubbling and mix well. Repeat this step if you decide it&#39;s still too acidic for your liking. Know that your salsa will foam up and discolor with this addition but, no worries - she&#39;ll settle right back down."
- "For a memorable contrast, add some additional fresh, fine chopped onions, jalapeños and cilantro to your salsa once it&#39;s fully cooled.                                                                                                             Serve with homemade, seasoned Tortilla Chips. Or, serve over or, alongside most any primary Mexican dish you choose. Enjoy!"
