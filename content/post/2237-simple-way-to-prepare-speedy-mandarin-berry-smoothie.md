- "1 the juice of 1 mandarin orange"
- "1 ice if desired"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add yogurt, berries, and juice to blender and blend for 30 seconds or more. The longer you mix, I use frappé setting, the more froth there is. Blending smoothies well makes them taste better, anyhow."
- "If you&#39;re adding ice, while the blender is running, remove the small inner cap from the lid and drop the ice in one by one. It gets crushed thoroughly this way."
- "A tip if you&#39;d like to sweeten this up a bit....adding organic honey is a great way to do so. It has healthy benefits as well. Add the honey with the yogurt and berries as it will harden up if added after the ice. You may want to blend just a little longer to incorporate the honey well."
