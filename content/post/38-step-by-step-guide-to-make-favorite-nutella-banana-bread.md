- "1/2 cup Softened butter"
- "2-3 tbsp Nutella or other hazelnut spread"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F;"

- "Mix in softened butter, sugar, vanilla extract and eggs and mix until everything is combined;"
- "Add in flour and mix until everything&#39;s combined. You should have a lumpy, doughy batter;"
- "Add Nutella and swirl until combined. You can either fully combine it or try to give it a slightly marbled effect;"
- "Pour mixture into a buttered baking dish (lather the whole pan to prevent sticking), ideally one that&#39;s long and tall (9x5), give it a few taps on a hard surface to let the air out and make it uniform then put it in the oven;"
- "Bake at 350°F for 40-50 minutes. Check by sticking a knife or skewer from top to bottom. If it comes out clean, it&#39;s ready. Note that it may not be completely clean because it&#39;s very moist. I wouldn&#39;t suggest leaving it longer than 55 minutes or it&#39;ll burn the perimiter;"
- "Let the bread cool on the counter before serving. Tastes great warm or cold."
