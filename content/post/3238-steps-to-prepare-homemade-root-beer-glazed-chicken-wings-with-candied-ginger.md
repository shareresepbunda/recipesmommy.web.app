recipeingredient:
- "48 oz root beer"
- "2 cup sugar for glaze"
- "2 large jalapenos minced optional"
- "4 tbsp cornstarch"
- "20 chicken wings"
- "2 large arms of ginger root minced"
- "1 1/2 cup water"
- "1 1/2 cup sugar for ginger"
- "1 tbsp butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large saucepan reduce, on medium heat, the root beer by about half."
- "Add the sugar to the root beer, and reduce heat to low heat."
- "In another small saucepan boil the minced ginger in the water until soft."
- "Take back about a half cup of the root beer solution from the saucepan and let it cool a bit, while still stirring the root beer in the saucepan."
- "Add the jalapenos to the saucepan, if you are using jalapenos."
- "When the set aside root beer is cooled a bit, add the cornstarch to that cooled bit of root beer, and stir.  If the root beer is too hot, you will create dumplings, so make sure it is cool."
- "When the cornstarch is thoroughly incorporated into a somewhat opaque but loose solution, add it to the saucepan rootbeer, but stir frantically while you pour in the cornstarch solution.  If the cornstarch solution is not loose enough, you may need to add a bit more rootbeer, slowly."
- "When the saucepan mixture begins to tighten up into a pudding consistency, turn off the heat."
- "The ginger should be pretty well boiled by now, so add the sugar for the ginger to the ginger and water mixture."
- "Reduce the ginger sugar water considerably, until the mixture is thick, gooey, and a bead of the mixture in cold water turns hard."
- "Pour the ginger solution into a buttered sheet pan, and spread to cool."
- "Drop the chicken into a bowl with some of the glaze, and mix it up."
- "After a few minutes, drop the wings into a hot oil-filled wok or deep fryer, and cook them until they are at least 160°F through and through."
- "Remove the chicken and place onto a cookie sheet."
- "Break the cooled ginger solution into little tiny bits."
- "Reglaze the chicken with the root beer glaze, sprinkle with ginger bits, and then broil the chicken for about another 5 minutes.  This ensures the glaze is up to a safe temp."
- "Cool, serve, and enjoy!"
