And if you want some sriracha on the side, why not?! Spicy mayo tastes great too, but alas, it ain&#39;t healthy. In small bowl, mix chili powder, garlic, lime peel, salt, black pepper and red pepper. Chili powder is the magic ingredient which gives these shrimp fajitas their spice. Hot sizzling meat and veggies fresh off the stove wrapped in a warmed tortilla and slathered with guacamole and salsa.
