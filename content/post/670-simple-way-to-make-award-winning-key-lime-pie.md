- " Crust "
- "1 1/2 cups Graham cracker crumbs"
- "6 tbsp. unsalted butter melted"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- " Filling "
- "4 oz. cream cheese softened to room temperature"
- "4 egg yolks"
- "1 can (14 oz.) sweetened condensed milk"
- "1/2 cup key lime juice"
- " zest of 1 lime optional for more of a tart flavor"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9&#34; pie pan with non-stick cooking spray and set aside."
- "Before getting started, if you&#39;re using fresh key limes for your pie, go ahead and squeeze them first. 1 lb. fresh key limes yields about 1/2 cup of juice. Strain any pulp or seeds out."
- "Start by making the crust. If you&#39;re using whole Graham crackers, then you need about 10 sheets to yield 1 1/2 cups. Either pulse them in a food processer for a few seconds or place them in a gallon sized Ziploc bag and crush them using a rolling pin."
- "Mix the Graham cracker crumbs, melted butter and sugar all together in a large bowl until combined and resembling a coarse, sandy mixture. Then, pour the crust mixture into the prepared pie pan and pack the crumbs around the pan and up the sides. I use the back of a small, metal dry measuring cup, but you can use your fingers to do this. Just make sure to pack the crumbs together well."
- "Bake the crust for 12 minutes. While it&#39;s baking, start to prepare the pie filling. Once the 12 minutes are up, remove the crust from the oven, but leave the oven on."
- "Using either a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in the egg yolks and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed."
- "Beat in the sweetened condensed milk, lime juice and lime zest (if using). Pour the filling into the warm crust."
- "Bake for 16-18 minutes, or until the sides are very lightly browned. Its ok if the center still has a slight jiggle."
- "Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then transfer it to the fridge and chill for at least 4 hours, before slicing and serving. Pie should be served chilled."
- "Keep any leftovers stored, covered, in the fridge for up to 3 says."
