- " garlic powder"

recipeinstructions:
- "Depending on how many pieces of bread you&#39;re going to make will determine how much butter you need. So get that butter and mix in some garlic powder (minced garlic would work too) into it to taste."
- "Spread garlic butter over the little pieces of bread from the sour dough flute."
- "Place bread slices onto baking sheet (i put tin foil under them so the bread doesn&#39;t stick). Add the shredded Parmesan cheese (other cheeses will work too) to the pieces of bread. If you&#39;re using the shredded Parmesan, you may want to make sure it&#39;s a single layer of cheese since it&#39;s not as easily melted as softer cheeses."
- "Set oven to 350 and put the bread in and cook for 8 mins or until the cheese is melted."
- "As a side note, the crusts for these are quite crunchy so if your children are too young, these may be too hard for them to eat"
