recipeingredient:
- "1 whole roasting chicken"
- "1 lemon just the zest"
- "2 tablespoons pepper"
- "3 tablespoons kosher salt"
- "1 bunch sage leaves"
- "1 onion"
- "3 carrots"
- "1 cup dry white wine"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, prepare the rub and vegetables. Combine the salt, pepper, and lemon zest in a small bowl and work with you fingers to combine (mixture will be slightly moist). Rough chop your vegetables. Set all these materials within easy reach."
- "Remove the chicken giblets from the chicken and discard (or save if using later). Rinse and pat dry."
- "Rub down the entire chicken (inside and out) with the lemon-pepper rub. Stuff cavity with some of the vegetables and sage."
- "Place chicken on a rack (I actually just use a mini cookie cooling rack placed inside a baking dish) and stick remaining vegetables and sage around the chicken."
- "Pop the prepped chicken in the fridge for a few hours to dry out the skin. You can do this up to 24 hours ahead of time (or skip if you’re in a rush)."
- "Preheat oven to 450 F. Add about a cup of white wine to the bottom of your pan, so that the liquid is just below the chicken (or a little more, if your pan is huge). You can use water if you don’t have wine. Roast the chicken for 10-15 mins at 450 F. This will give a nice crispy skin."
- "Turn oven down to 350 F and roast for an additional 20 mins per pound."
- "Take chicken out of oven and allow to sit for 20 mins or so before carving. Save the drippings for gravy!"
