Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and preheat. These crispy baked chicken wings are extra crispy on the outside and very juicy inside. They taste like deep-fried wings, only After tossing baked chicken wings in sauce or sauce and butter mix they will become less crispy. If you want optimal crispiness, serve them with a wing sauce on the side. I usually quadruple the amount of cayenne (i like it spicy) then once they are fried I coat in buffalo sauce and throw in the oven for a few minutes to make some delightfully spicy &amp; relatively clean to eat wings.
