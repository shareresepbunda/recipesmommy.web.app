recipeingredient:
- "150 g Plain Flour"
- "75 g softened unsalted butter"
- "50 g icing sugar sifted"
- "1 egg yolk or 12 tablespoons of water if intolerant to eggs"
- "1 heaped teaspoon raspberry jam per tart"
- "1 heaped teaspoon crunchy peanut butter per tart"
- "200 g milk chocolate melted"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, make your pastry. Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Then, sift in your icing sugar and mix it in with the flour mixture. Add the egg yolk or water and mix it in so that it forms a soft dough. If you find that the dough is too short you can add a tablespoon (or less) of water extra."
- "Wrap the dough in clingfilm and pop it into the fridge to &#34;rest&#34; for half an hour. Pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees centigrade/Gas mark 6."
- "Roll out your pastry to roughly half a centimetre thick and cut into 6 circles to fit your tart tins (about 7 cms across). Press into tart tins and then blind bake for 20 minutes. I used baking beans in mine to ensure an even bake and no rise etc."
- "Allow the pastry cases to cool, remove baking beans (or whatever you&#39;ve used) and then add your jam &amp; peanut butter to the bases. Mix them together in situ carefully and spread evenly."
- "Melt your chocolate and cover &amp; spread across your jam/peanut butter layer in the tart cases (about 3 teaspoons of melted chocolate per tart). Pop them into the fridge to set. To finish &amp; for decoration you could dust with some icing sugar. Voila, enjoy!"
