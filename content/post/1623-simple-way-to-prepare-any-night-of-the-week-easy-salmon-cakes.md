I&#39;ve never been a big fan of seafood, but I do love salmon. If you enjoy seafood, salmon cakes can be a tasty new way to enjoy a fish dinner. Instead of a fork or spoon, it may be easier to combine the salmon and cracker meal with clean hands. Most salmon cakes are loaded with breadcrumbs, Panko, or even potatoes to bind ingredients together and to make more hearty patties.
