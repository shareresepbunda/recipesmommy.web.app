This no banana berry smoothie is sweet from the berries, creamy from the greek yogurt, and I love the tang and acidity from the orange juice. This smoothie is a little sweeter than other green smoothies you&#39;ve probably seen, but most of the sugar comes naturally from the frozen fruit and I used orange. This mixed berry smoothie is simply frozen berries, banana, vanilla Greek yogurt, liquid of your choice, and sweetener if you desire. I buy bags of mixed frozen berries and always have a few in the freezer for when a smoothie craving strikes.
