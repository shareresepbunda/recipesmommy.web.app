- "It should look something like this."
- "Chill the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes. (If the dough is still cool to the touch and easy to handle, you can skip this step and continue preparing the dough in Step 8)."
- "Prepare the egg mixture. Whisk  the egg yolks with a little warmed milk in a bowl."

- "Line the muffin pan with the shortcrust prepared in Step 3: First, divide up the dough."
- "Press the pie crust into the muffin pan. (Press it in the bottom of the pan and stretch it to fit.) Work quickly or the dough will get soft and be hard to handle."
- "You can also roll the dough out into circles between sheets of plastic wrap. (This is different from the original recipe, but I do it this way when the dough is too soft.)"
- "Chill the pan in the fridge for 20 minutes."
- "Mix the heavy cream into the chilled custard mixture from Step 7. Lastly, stir in the vanilla extract."
- "The smooth and creamy custard is ready."
- "Fill the tart shells with the custard."

- "Done. These are absolutely the best eaten piping hot, right out of the oven. But then again, I also love them ice cold. I just can&#39;t seem to make up my mind..."
