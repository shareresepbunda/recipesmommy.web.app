recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "1 tsp Instant dry yeast"
- "30 grams Granulated sugar"
- "1/3 tsp Salt"
- "20 grams Butter"
- "140 ml Lukewarm water"
- "2 bags  Chocolate coated barley puffs 15 g per bag"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, combine flour, yeast, sugar and salt (keeping the salt separate from the yeast). Aiming for the yeast, add in the lukewarm water. Once the dough has been mixed well, like you are kneading, add in the butter. Once it&#39;s smooth, knead for 15 minutes."
- "Once you are done kneading, make sure to pull and tuck in the edges, forming the dough into a ball. Grease a bowl lightly with oil (not listed in ingredients) and place the ball of dough in it. Cover this with plastic wrap or a tightly wrung out damp towel. In your oven on the bread proofing setting, or in a warm place, let the dough rise for the first time for about 40-60 minutes."
- "Once it&#39;s done rising, the dough should have doubled in size. Poke the center of the dough with your finger to see if the hole closes up. If it doesn&#39;t, you&#39;re good to go. Next take the dough out and gently punch it to deflate. Divide the dough into two portions and ball up each one like you did in Step 2. Cover them with plastic wrap or a tightly wrung out damp towel and let them rest for about 10 minutes."
- "With a rolling pin, roll out each portion of dough into a 23 cm x 15 cm rectangle, with the longer sides on the horizontal axis."
- "Leaving about 3 cm free at the top of each rectangle of dough, sprinkle the chocolate coated barley puffs. Press down gently on the puffs to push them slightly into the dough."
- "From the bottom, roll the dough up and be sure to pinch the seams closed. With the seam side facing downward, cut each roll into 8 portions."
- "Turning the portions onto their flatter cross-sectioned sides, line them up on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Cover them once again with plastic wrap or a tightly wrung damp towel, and let the dough rise a second time for 20-30 minutes."
- "After the dough is finished proofing, bake the rolls for 13-15 minutes at 180℃ (350℉)."
- "All done."
