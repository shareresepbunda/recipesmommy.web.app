recipeingredient:
- " Bread"
- "1 lb bread flour"
- "1 packages dried yeast"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp sugar"
- "2 oz butter"
- "1/2 pints warm water"
- " quiche"
- "1 lb allpurpose flour"
- "8 oz butter"

- "3 eggs"
- "1/3 pints milk"
- " seasoning"
- "6 oz hard cheese mature"
- "1 onion chopped"
- "1/2 lb bacon or ham"
- " jam tarts"
- " Left over pastry from quiche"

recipeinstructions:
- "Put all bread ingredients into a bowl and mix either with your mixer on a low setting with dough hook attachment or by hand"
- "Dough should be kneaded for at least 5 minutes in machine or 10 minutes by hand (stretching and folding to activate the gluten)"
- "Cover and leave in a warm place for at least an hour"
- "Make the pastry for the quiche"
- "Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl and rub the butter in to form a breadcrumb appearance"
- "Add cold water a tablespoon at a time and bring together in the bowl (I use a butter knife to cut and stir as pastry benefits from lack of touch)"
- "Wrap pastry in cling film and put in the fridge for an hour"
- "Gently fry the chopped bacon and onions, then leave to cool"
- "Turn your mixer back on to knock back the dough or knead again for 5 minutes to squish out the air bubbles. Place in a loaf tin, slash the top and sprinkle with flour. Put back in a warm place for half an hour to rise again"
- "When you are ready to start baking preheat the oven to 200ºC gas 6"
- "Roll out your pastry quite thinly (about 1/8 inch) to fit a 6&#34; loose bottomed tin. Grease tin, place pastry snuggly in base and up the sides then trim the edges"
- "Set aside leftover pastry"
- "(If you are using a glass or ceramic flan tray you will need to blind bake your pastry for 20 minutes)"
- "Place onion/bacon mixture in base"
- "Mix together eggs, milk and seasoning and pour into quiche"
- "Sprinkle cheese over top (I add a sliced tomato)"
- "Now roll out your leftover pastry and cut it rounds to fit a cupcake/muffin tray (shallow is best for tarts)"
- "Fill with whatever you like - remember jams etc expand whilst cooking so don&#39;t overfill"
- "Put bread on top shelf, quiche on middle and tarts on bottom"
- "After half an hour remove bread and tarts and move the quiche to top shelf for a further 10 minutes"
- "Turn bread out immediately or steam will give you a soggy bottom! To test bread is cooked through, tap the bottom and it should have a hollow sound. Leave on a rack to cool (for as long as you can resist)"
- "Remove tarts from tin after 10 minutes, especially if jam has bubbled over, just give time for the jam to harden a little a it will be to fluid at first"
- "Remove quiche and cool in tin"
