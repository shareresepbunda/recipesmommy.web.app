- "Keep adding, folding and coating until the biscuits do not have much sauce to coat. Stop adding in the biscuits. *You will have to judge. If the biscuits are less than the sauce, you will not get a beautiful outline as you slice the cake. If the biscuits are too many, it will not hold it&#39;s shape well when chilled.*"
- "Transfer into the cake pan, distributing to the edges, making sure all corners are well covered. Using an offset spatula, press to compact the biscuits mixture.  *It is okay to use a bit of strength as the biscuits have softened during the cooking process.*"

- "Set aside for a couple of mins. Stir to combine well and until the chocolate has completely melted. Add a pinch of salt and 1/2 TSP of vanilla."
- "Give it a final stir to combine well. Pour this chocolate ganache over the biscuit layer. Swirl the cake pan to distribute the ganache evenly."
- "Give it a few taps on the counter to remove any excess air bubbles. Chill in the fridge overnight to set. Unmold and dust with raw cacao powder and milo. Slice to trim off the edges. Slice and serve immediately."
