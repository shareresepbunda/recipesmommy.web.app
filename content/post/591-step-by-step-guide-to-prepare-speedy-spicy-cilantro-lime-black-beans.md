Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, spicy cilantro lime black beans. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Black beans that were slow simmered with spices and served with white rice and spicy shrimp. Now obviously traditional style cuban black beans don&#39;t have cilantro and lime so they&#39;re a little more neutral in terms of flavor but man were they comforting. The black beans cook in vegetable stock with minced garlic and dried cilantro, and if you have some I&#39;d add the Mexican herb called Epazote. When they&#39;re cooked the beans get spicier with chopped cilantro, diced green chiles, and some lime juice that cooks with the beans for a few minutes.
