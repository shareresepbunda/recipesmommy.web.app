recipeingredient:
- "1 large chicken breast cut into thin bite sized chunks"
- "Half a white onion sliced"
- "3 spring onions sliced"
- "Half a medium carrot cut into thin strips optional"
- "2 large cloves garlic sliced into thin pieces"
- "1 red chilli seeds left in half sliced into rings"
- "1/2 tsp garlic granules"
- "2 tbsp corn flour or potato starch"
- " Ground Black Pepper"
- " Sea or table salt"
- " Vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up a thin layer (around 2-3mm) of oil up in a wok over a high heat. In a bowl add the cornflour/potato starch and add a good pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Add the garlic granules. Combine."
- "Take the chicken pieces and coat them with the flour mixture. Add them to the oil once nice and hot so it sizzles once the chicken is added."

- "Drain away the oil from the wok to remove any debris from the flour. Return to the heat. If needed add a tiny dash of oil to the wok then add the white onions and carrots, (some takeaways don&#39;t add carrots to this dish, so adapt to what you prefer). Fry quickly for around 2 minutes whilst moving it around the wok. Next add in the spring onion and chillies and garlic. Toss and fry it in the pan until fragrant."
- "Return the chicken pieces to the wok. Add a bit more black pepper and a pinch of salt. Toss everything together then remove from the heat."
- "Serve up immediately while hot and crispy! Enjoy."
