recipeingredient:
- "4 each Slice of Bread"
- "5 each Eggs"
- "1/4 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 Cinnamon sugar"
- "1 dash ground cinnamon"
- "1/4 cup 2 milk or half and half"
- "1 dash salt and pepper"
- "1 small amount of buttermargarine"
- "1 nonstick spray"
- "1 each small glass cup"
recipeinstructions:
- "Use the small glass cup, I used a wine glass for its small opening, and press firmly down onto the center of each slice of bread. Twisting slightly to avoid tearing."
- "Slowly pull up on the glass and the center of the bread should have a perfect round hole with the cut out inside the glass. Set the cut out aside for now. Do this for every slice of bread."
- "Spread a thin layer of butter onto both sides of the bread slices, now with holes. Set aside"
- "Heat up a skillet on medium heat."
- "Take one egg and crack into a small bowl. Add milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and a little salt to the bowl. Whisk together well and set aside."
- "At this point your skillet should be hot enough. Grease the bottom with either non-stick spray or butter."
- "Drop one slice of bread, or two if your skillet is large enough, onto the skillet and quickly crack an egg and drop it into the center of the bread."
- "Let cook until you can see the whites bubble a bit and flip over. Be careful to not let the egg flip out of the center of the bread. Add a dash of salt and pepper to the egg if desired. If you&#39;re having trouble flipping, use a spatula to hold the egg in place on top, and another spatula to flip it over. --Repeat this step for each slice of bread."
- "Now dip the bread holes into your French toast mix and let soak for approximately 15 seconds. Just enough to absorb the mixture."
- "Then, like any French toast, cook on skillet until golden brown."
- "This serves 2-4 people. I put syrup into a small dish and used it as dipping sauce for my sliders. And also spread jelly onto the Birds in a Crater toast. This probably isn&#39;t the healthiest of meals, but it taste really good. Add bacon or whatever else you might want."
