Over the years, trifles [in America] have been adapted to fit into a family&#39;s tastes. Some use pudding, some don&#39;t include sherry or Madeira wine, but instead non-alcoholic juices, and some even use chocolate and other ingredients. Another reason that the trifle has been adapted is simply out of necessity. Essentially, a trifle needs a sponge cake soaked in sherry (for adults) or fruit juice (for a nonalcoholic version), a thick layer of creamy custard, and a deep layer of lightly whipped fresh cream. The rest is all about personal preference.
