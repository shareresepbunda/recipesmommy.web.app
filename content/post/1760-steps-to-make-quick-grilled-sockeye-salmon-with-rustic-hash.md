- "Back to the fish- after salmon has cooked 6-8 minutes, and begins to flake, gently turn fillets over to lightly grill the top side for about 1 minute. This will add just a little color and char to the top."
- "Transfer salmon to a platter, skin side down. Lightly spritz tops of the fish with a few fresh-squeezed lemon wedges."
- "Time to plate! Make a nice bed of hash in center of the plate. Place a piece of salmon on top. The fish can be served with or without the skin as you prefer. Garnish dish with a pinch of chives or chopped green onion."

Grilling salmon without skin can be a mess, as the flesh sticks to the grill and falls through the cracks. In addition, Coho salmon has delicate flavor yet firm texture. When given the option, I always choose the fattiest salmon that will yield the moistest result, but that&#39;s my own personal preference. Grill some corn on the cob and asparagus along with it for a fantastic meal.
